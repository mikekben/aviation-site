<h3>  Welcome to the aviation site!</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"> 
Modern aviation (at least in pre-pandemic times) combines the wonders of physics with the joys of traveling and brings people around the world closer together. 
To make those amazing feats possible, the world has constructed an amazing amount of physical infrastructure--airports, aircraft, navigational beacons--and important abstractions
to make keeping track of each complexity in running an international airline possible. One of the main abstractions is the use of airport codes to disambiguate locations used
by airlines.
